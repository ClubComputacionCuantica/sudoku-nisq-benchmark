## Introduction

Why Sudoku?

Sudoku is a natural example of a **constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)**, and **generalized Sudoku** is known to be **NP-complete**. It offers:

- Familiarity to a general audience
- Clean problem encoding with known structure
- Natural translation into **exact cover** and other CSP formulations

This makes Sudoku accessible to study current limitations of quantum devices.
