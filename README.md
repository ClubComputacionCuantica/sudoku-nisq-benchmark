## Introduction
** AI generated draft
* Also mention that it offers an accessible view to real quantum computing applied to a familiar problem

This repository contains a designed to demonstrate how **Sudoku puzzles can serve as accessible benchmarking problems for near-term quantum devices** (NISQ era). It integrates **puzzle generation**, **quantum circuit construction using multiple algorithms**, **resource analysis**, and **hardware transpilation**.

Our framework offers a transparent, pedagogically meaningful, and technically rigorous approach to understanding the limitations and variability of quantum processors when applied to small but non-trivial constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).

---

## Goals
- Provide a **publicly understandable benchmarking method** for NISQ hardware.
- Use well-defined, **NP-complete problems (generalized Sudoku)** as a testbed.
- Explore and compare **different quantum algorithms** on the same problem.
- Enable reproducible studies on **hardware resource constraints**, **transpilation effects**, and **solution fidelity**.

---

## Key Features
- üìÑ Random or user-defined Sudoku puzzles $n^2 \times n^2$
- ‚öõÔ∏è Three quantum algorithms: Grover-based exact cover and graph coloring approaches, and quantum backtracking
- üõ†Ô∏è Transpilation and execution on real hardware
- üìä Data generation + analysis for comparing hardware and algorithm performance

## Why Sudoku?

Sudoku is a natural example of a **constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)**, and **generalized Sudoku** is known to be **NP-complete**. It offers:

- Familiarity to a general audience
- Clean problem encoding with known structure
- Natural translation into **exact cover** and other CSP formulations

This makes Sudoku both accessible and rigorous enough to expose current limitations of quantum devices.

## Basic Usage

Refer to the example Jupyter notebooks for generating puzzles, constructing quantum circuits, benchmarking, and visualizing results.

```python
from sudoku_nisq.q_sudoku import Sudoku

sudoku = Sudoku(subgrid_size=2, missing_cells=5)
sudoku.plot()
sudoku.quantum.get_circuit()
sudoku.quantum.find_resources()
```

For benchmarking on IBM backends:

```python
from pytket.extensions.qiskit import IBMQBackend
backend = IBMQBackend("ibm_oslo")
circuit = sudoku.quantum.get_circuit()
compiled = backend.get_compiled_circuit(circuit)
result = backend.get_result(backend.process_circuit(compiled, n_shots=100))
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Poetry

### Steps

---

## Quantum Algorithms Implemented

- **Grover-based Sudoku Solvers**: Transforms Sudoku to an exact cover problem or a graph coloring problem, then applies Grover search.
- **Quantum Backtracking**: Uses A. Montanaro's quantum backtracking algorithm.

Each method has different trade-offs in circuit depth and hardware compatibility.

---

## Benchmarking Objectives

We use this framework to study:
- Logical vs transpiled resource counts (qubits, CX gates, depth)
- Performance degradation across hardware backends
- Algorithm scalability with puzzle difficulty

Metrics collected include:
- Gate counts
- Qubit usage
- Execution time
- Success probability (solution state detection)

---

## Current Limitations

- Real hardware cannot yet reliably solve even small 4x4 puzzles without heavy error.
- Circuits are not yet fully optimized.
- Hardware variability makes reproducibility difficult across platforms.
- Limited testing beyond IBMQ.

---

## Future Work

- Benchmark across multiple QPUs
- Explore quantum counting to estimate number of solutions
- Include error mitigation techniques (zero-noise extrapolation, purification)
- Create an interactive web interface or dashboard
